Linear Regression
-----------------


Instructions for running the code

1| Python 3.6 or higher required. Libraries matplotlib
 and numpy should be installed in the system.
2| Current directory is the working directory. Keep the
 training, dev and test files in it.
3| Run the following on the terminal
~$ python regression.py -dtype <1d/2d> -m <ridge/least_squares> -t <TRAINING_DATA> -d <DEV_DATA> -test <TEST_DATA>
For further information, use
~$ python regression.py --help
You might want to use python3 instead of python, depending on the system.
4| Expect the results as a fit plot will pop up on your screen in a while.
 Meanwhile, experience the process with the interactive design of the program.
